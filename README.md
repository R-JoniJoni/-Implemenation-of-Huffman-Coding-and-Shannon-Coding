#Please Note: All the comments in the python code are written in Chinese. I am sorry if you don't understand.
The program is by python. Detailed functions of the python code are as follow:
1. Compute the entropy of “Steve Jobs Speech.doc”.
2. Apply the Huffman coding method and Shannon coding method for “Steve Jobs Speech.txt”. Output the letters/punctuation/space and their Huffman codewords and Shannon codes.
3. Compute the average code length of “Steve Jobs Speech.txt” using Huffman codes and Shannon codes, respectively.
4. Note: For the Huffman codeis developed to generate a Q-ary Huffman code, where Q is an input variable which should be an integer.
